## Project Overview

The 2048 game offers players a straightforward yet engaging way to challenge their strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. 
The objective is simple: combine tiles with the same numbers to create the elusive 2048 tile, all while avoiding a gridlock.

With its clean design, easy-to-learn gameplay, and endless replayability, 
2048 exemplifies how a minimalistic concept can provide hours of entertainment and intellectual challenge.

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,sass,js,vscode,github)](https://skillicons.dev)

-	HTML5
-	SCSS (Sass)
- JavaScript (JS): Used for application logic.

## <h2 id="features">Features</h2>

-	**Game Logic:** The game is built entirely using JavaScript, implementing core logic with functions and constructors to manage the merging of tiles and the progression toward the 2048 tile.
-	**Conditional Rendering:** Conditional rendering is used to dynamically update the game grid and display game over or win messages when the player reaches the target tile or fills the grid.
-	**Error Handling:** The game includes error handling for situations such as invalid moves or grid overflow, displaying appropriate messages to inform the player of any issues.
-	**Event Handling:** Uses event listeners for user interactions (keyboard or swipe gestures) to move the tiles, providing a smooth and responsive gameplay experience.
-	**Game Reset:** Includes a game reset feature, allowing the player to restart the game at any time without reloading the page.
-	**State Management:** Manages the game state (tile positions, score, and game status) using simple JavaScript objects, ensuring real-time updates to the game grid and score display.
- **Performance Optimization:** The app is optimized to handle game logic efficiently without unnecessary recalculations or delays, ensuring a smooth experience even after multiple tile merges.
-	**Animations:** Smooth animations are incorporated to visually enhance tile movements and merges, improving the player‚Äôs engagement and satisfaction.
